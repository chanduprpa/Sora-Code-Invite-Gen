### üöÄ Recommended Configuration

For optimal performance, it is strongly advised to use the **Mozilla Firefox** browser and connect through a **VPN server located in the USA**. This configuration helps in replicating the request headers that are most frequently accepted by the API.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Operates

1.  **Code Generation**: The script fabricates random 6-character invitation codes following the `0A1B2C` pattern.
2.  **Concurrent Submission**: It employs multiple threads to submit these codes to the Sora API at a rapid pace.
3.  **Response Management**:
    *   A **successful** code (200 OK) is logged in `success.txt`.
    *   An **invalid** code (403 Forbidden) is recorded in `invalid_codes.txt` and is not retried.
    *   If **rate-limited** (429 Too Many Requests), the script will pause and re-attempt.
    *   In case of **authentication failure** (401 Unauthorized), the script will halt and prompt you to refresh your token.
4.  **Intelligent Caching**: The script is designed with a "blacklist cache" system. It utilizes `used_codes.txt` and `invalid_codes.txt` to prevent the re-testing of any code that has been previously attempted, whether it was successful, invalid, or simply used. This feature enhances efficiency, particularly when the script is stopped and restarted.

> **üí° Jumpstart Your Progress!** This package is pre-loaded with `invalid_codes.txt`, containing **10,000 known invalid codes**. This will save you time and minimize superfluous API requests, as the script will automatically bypass these codes.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Please follow these instructions meticulously to ensure the script runs smoothly.

### Step 1: Initial Setup

1.  Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
2.  Execute the `install.bat` file by double-clicking it. This will establish a virtual environment and install the required libraries.

### Step 2: Acquiring Your Authentication Token (Using Firefox)

This is a crucial step. The script requires your personal authentication token to function.

1.  Launch **Mozilla Firefox** and sign in to `https://sora.chatgpt.com`.
2.  Open the **Developer Tools** by pressing the `F12` key.
3.  Navigate to the **Network** tab.
4.  If the panel is empty, either refresh the page or go to `https://sora.chatgpt.com/explore`.
5.  In the filter input box (üîç), enter `sora` to isolate requests made to the Sora server.
6.  Select any request from the filtered list.
7.  In the right-hand pane, locate the **Headers** section and scroll to **Request Headers**.
8.  Find the `authorization` header, which will appear as:
    `authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
9.  **Copy the extensive string of characters** that follows `Bearer `.
10. Paste the copied token into the `auth.txt` file. **Do not include `Bearer `**. Save the file.

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning Script Parameters (Optional)

You can adjust the script's performance by modifying the `params.txt` file.

-   `max_workers`: Determines the number of threads for code submission. A higher number can increase speed but also the likelihood of being rate-limited.
-   `delay`: The interval (in seconds) between code processing. A longer delay is generally safer.
-   `max_retries`: The number of times the script will attempt to resubmit a code after a rate-limit error.
-   `retry_delay`: The initial waiting period (in seconds) before a retry.

The default values in `params.txt` are a reliable starting point if you are uncertain.

### Step 4: Obtaining Your Device ID and User Agent (Using Firefox)

The script needs to emulate your specific browser's signature.

1.  Within the same **Network** tab where you located your token, find the `OAI-Device-Id` and `User-Agent` headers, which are typically listed below the authentication token.
2.  Copy the values for both of these headers.
3.  Open the `config.txt` file provided with the script.
4.  Substitute the placeholder values with your `OAI-Device-Id` and `User-Agent`. Save the file.

### Step 5: Executing the Script

After completing the preceding steps, you are ready to launch the script.

**For Windows users:**
-   Double-click the `run.bat` file.

The script will commence, displaying its progress. You can halt the script at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## üìÇ File Directory

-   `sora.py`: The core Python script.
-   `auth.txt`: **(Your input required)** Your confidential authentication token.
-   `config.txt`: **(Your input required)** Your browser's Device ID and User Agent.
-   `params.txt`: **(Your input required)** Script settings such as thread count and delays.
-   `install.bat`: **(Run this initially)** Configures the Python virtual environment.
-   `run.bat`: **(Run this to begin)** Activates the environment and initiates the script.
-   `success.txt`: Created automatically. Stores all successfully submitted codes.
-   `invalid_codes.txt`: **Pre-populated with 10,000 invalid codes!** A "blacklist" of codes that are confirmed to be invalid. The script will not attempt to generate these codes.
